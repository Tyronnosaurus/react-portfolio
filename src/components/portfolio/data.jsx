            <p>My main task as lead PLC programmer in Ultrasion was to organize 7 years worth of code by many different programmers. Most it was patched as needed as the ultrasonic molding research progressed. This led to a very high technological debt: no documentation, many dependencies between supposedly encapsulated programs, unused and redundant code, obsolete functionality and a confusing user interface.</p>
            <p>At the time of my incorporation, there were no programmers left to tutor me. I proceeded to read and understand all the software and hardware, and carefully rewrote it over the span of a year. Some of the tasks I did were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created documentation.</li>
                <li>Simplified many sequences (with the biggest having about 150 states).</li>
                <li>Improved encapsulation.</li>
                <li>Improved data sampling and exporting.</li>
                <li>Simplified HMI for better user experience.</li>
                <li>Designed hardware changes to improve safety and compatibility with an external robot arm.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The axes had mechanical differences which meant the homing and anti-collision systems had to be rewritten.</li>

        <p>After installing a pressure sensor at the piston, I developed the PI controller shown.</p>
        <p>The implementation was particularly tricky as the plastic being pushed was continuously melting and flowing into the mold cavities.
